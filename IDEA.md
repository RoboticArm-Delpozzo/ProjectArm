# ROBOTiCARM-DELPOZZO
# OUR IDEA
## Security Camera System
### We want to make a Raspberry Pi-based robotic arm made using a 3D printer

Our product will detect people using the raspberry pi camera and will follow them using the robot movable limbs. 
Once it detects someone, it will take a photo of him and will send it to the system administrator.


## What we need to build it?
+ 1 RaspberryPi Computer
+ 1 RaspberryPi Camera
+ 1 RaspberryPI ServoMotor
+ 3d printer
