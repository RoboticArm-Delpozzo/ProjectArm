# LogBook

## - **01/21/2021**
+ Define our idea and how to improve it (it is all into "IDEA.md").
+ Start to design our roboric arm, starting from the support base (find it in the "3d models" directory).

## - **01/28/2021**
+ Redesign our support base to make it a little thicker (the first version was too slim to hold the arm).
+ Write almost all of the code to: use raspberry pi camera to detect faces, capture the passerby's photo and store it, send the photo by email.
  Programs are into the "source" directory.
+ Print a test object using the 3d printer.

## - **02/04/2021**
+ Code debugging

## - **02/11/2021**
+ Complete the robot base
+ Search for information about raspberryPi servomotor

## - **03/18/2021**
+ complete and test code
+ adjust hardware components

## - **04/08/2021**
+ testing and debug
+ start arm assembly

## - **04/15/2021**
+ end arm assembly
+ testing
+ figure out new features (mhz19 or Tello...)

## - **04/29/2021**
+find out what new sensor we want to use: pushbutton to manually turn off the robot
+serch on the internet useful materials (such as codes or guide to implement new features)

## - **04/29/2021**
+ try to run the arm (unexpected pin error)
