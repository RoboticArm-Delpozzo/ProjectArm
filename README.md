# LogBook

## - **01/21/2021**
+ Define our idea and how to improve it (it is all into "IDEA.md").
+ Start to design our roboric arm, starting from the support base (find it in the "3d models" directory).

## - **01/28/2021**
+ Redesign our support base to make it a little thicker (the first version was too slim to hold the arm).
+ Write almost all of the code to: use raspberry pi camera to detect faces, capture the passerby's photo and store it, send the photo by email.
  Programs are into the "source" directory.
+ Print a test object using the 3d printer.
